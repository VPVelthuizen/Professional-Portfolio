Professional Portfolio

I am creating a repository to develop a website that will show my professional portfolio and showcase some of my coding skills and projects I have completed.

This repository will be stored on Github and can be accessed at https://vpvelthuizen.github.io/Professional-Portfolio

This repository does not require any installs or special equipment to access, only a web browser.
